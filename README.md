## Project Description:
The project implements a REST API service for interacting with applications of the YaMDb project.
The YaMDb project collects user reviews on works. Works are divided into categories: "Books," "Movies," "Music." The list of categories can be expanded by the administrator.
In each category, there are works: books, movies, or music. A work can be assigned a genre from a list of predefined ones. Only the administrator can create new genres.
Users leave textual reviews for works and rate works on a scale from one to ten; the user ratings are used to calculate an average work rating. A user can leave only one review for a work.
Users can also leave an unlimited number of comments on reviews.
